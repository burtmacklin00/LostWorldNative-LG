// CLASSIC > RANDOM SPAWNS: the arcade game with its encounters shuffled.
//
// Each shooting stop is a script of the game's encounter machine (words at
// 0x1268B8, docs/game_ram.md). When an encounter starts, its words are put back
// as they are in the ROM and then changed in place, keeping their number and
// every camera turn, wait, sound and cutscene: the camera walks the stage path
// as in the arcade. What changes: the spawn position group and sometimes the
// type of each raptor (only for ones the zone uses where the camera looks),
// the position of enemies placed by coordinates (the stage 2 river), when each
// enemy comes, and the order of runs of plain sections (camera turn, enemies,
// wait). Bosses get a random amount of life.
