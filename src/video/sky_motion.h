// Sub-pixel motion of the 2D layers below the 3D image (the sky) between
// game frames.
//
// The game scrolls the sky in whole pixels as the camera turns, so its scroll
// is a rounded sample of a smooth motion: 10, 10, 11, 11, 11, 12... on a slow
// turn. Drawn between frames by its last step (SkyPack / compose.frag before
// this), the sky went on by a whole pixel after each step and came back when
// the next frame had none: a tremor at 4 pixels of a 1440p screen, worst when
// the camera moved slowly or came to rest. Here each row's scroll is
// reconstructed at sub-pixel precision from the samples seen so far:
//
// - A row's recent positions (up to 16 frames) are taken as a corridor: the
//   true position at each frame lies within half a pixel of the integer the
//   game wrote. The longest run of newest samples that one constant velocity
//   can pass through gives the plausible velocities (an interval); a step
//   change that no velocity explains (a cut) starts the history again.
// - The velocity drawn in between is the world camera's turn in this frame
//   (R3DRenderer's pose, converted at 4096 / 2pi pixels per radian: the
//   game's own scale, measured) when it lies within the corridor's range plus
//   a tolerance; otherwise the middle of the range. The camera moves the
//   scenery, so the sky follows exactly what it will be next to; its single
//   frame blips (the world tracker's) fall outside the corridor and are ignored.
// - The position at the frame goes on from where the sky was drawn at the end
//   of the previous one when the scroll seen allows it (no jump at all), else
//   the nearest point allowed: within a pixel of the game's own scroll with
//   the camera leading, half a pixel without it. The sky never drifts away
//   from where the game put it, and never steps back against its motion.
//
// Fed once per 2D frame with TileGen's back_rows (the layer and scroll of
// each screen row); solved once per 2D frame when the renderer draws it, with
// the camera's turn when the 3D frame of the same vblank is on screen. Its
// output is two rows of texels for compose.frag (x, then y): per screen row
// R = the integer step since the previous frame + 128 (a 0 texel: nothing
// known for this row), G = the sub-pixel offset of the position at the frame
// from the game's scroll ((G / 255 - 0.5) * 2 pixels), B:A = the velocity in
// pixels per vblank as a 16-bit number of 1/256 pixel biased by 32768. The
// shader draws the row's picture at scroll + offset + velocity * (how far the
// 3D has gone from the previous frame to this one, in vblanks).
