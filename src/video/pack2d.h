// Replacements for 2D graphics (tilegen layers above the 3D image), such as
// the route map shown before each stage.
//
// The foreground 2D image is split into 8x8-pixel cells. A replacement is a
// rectangle of cells with the hash each cell had when it was captured, plus a
// picture to show there. While most of those cells are on screen unchanged the
// picture replaces them; cells that differ (the route drawn so far, the hint
// text) keep the game's own pixels on top, so live information is not lost.
//
// Files in textures/2d/: <name>.txt (made by tools/make_2d_replacement.py from
// a capture) and <name>.png (the new picture, any resolution, with alpha).
